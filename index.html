    <p>Hello! Today, I felt a lot of different emotions.
        I was sad a little earlier because my dad keeps asking Devonte and I to do ridiculous things to help with the
        furniture sales for Sonya and Louis-Philippe's house.
        It's honestly genuinely ridiculous. I was mad and disappointed because after telling me we would meet up today
        in West Palm Beach, he stood me up. My own dad...
        Yeah! But alas. Other than that, today was actually pretty nice!
